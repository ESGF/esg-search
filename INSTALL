Installation and running instructions for the ESGF search services.

INSTALLING AND BUILDING FROM THE COMMAND LINE

Retrieve the software from the ESGF git repository with one of the following commands:

- git clone git@esg-repo.llnl.gov:esg-search.git (if you have an ssh git account)
- git clone git://esg-repo.llnl.gov/esg-search.git (if you don't have an ssh git account)

The bulding process is based on Apache Ant (to execute tasks) and Ivy (to manage and download dependencies).
After downloading the software, execute the following commands:
- cd esg-search
- ant make_dist (to build the distribution jars)
- ant test (to run the tests)


INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING APACHE SOLR FOR ESG

o Download the latest version of Apache Solr from the the web site: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ 
(at the time of this writing, the latest distribution is apache-solr-1.4.1.tar)
	- tar xvf apache-solr-1.4.1.tar
	- cd apache-solr-1.4.1.tar
o Customize the example directory to use the ESGF specific configuration:
	- cd examples
	- cp <esg-search install>/src/java/test/solr/conf/schema.xml solr/conf/.
	- cp <esg-search install>/src/java/test/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml solr/conf/.
o start the server:
	- java -jar start.jar
o test the server is running by accessing the URL: http://localhost:8983/solr/ in a web browser


RUNNING THE HARVESTING TOOL

The application comes with a command-line program that can be used to experiment with harvesting metadata records into a Solr engine.

o Start an Apache Solr engine configured with the specific ESGF schema as described above.

o If desired, edit the file src/java/main/esg/search/config/harvest-context.xml to customize the consumption of incoming XML metadata records.
By default, the application is configured to send the records for processing to the Solr engine available at: http://localhost:8983/solr, and at the same
time to write the serialized records to the /tmp directory (for debugging and informative purposes).

o Run the Java class HarvestingServiceMain supplying it with the URL of a metadata repository, and the type of that repository. Note that at
this time the application can parse THREDDS catalogs, records coming from a OAI/DIF repository, and from  CAS/RDF repository. Also, some example
XML documents are provided in the "resources/" subdirectory.

For example, to test ingestion of a single THREDDS catalog run the following command:

o cd <esg-search install>
o cd build (this directory contains the .class files after you have run "ant make_dist")
o java -Dlog4j.configuration=./log4j.xml -Djava.ext.dirs=../lib/:../lib/fetched esg.search.harvest.impl.HarvestingServiceMain file:///Users/cinquini/Documents/workspace/esg-search/resources/pcmdi.ipcc4.GFDL.gfdl_cm2_0.picntrl.mon.land.run1.v1.xml THREDDS
o a search for "snow" in the Solr admin interface available at http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/ will return one record

Or, to ingest all XML records contained in a serialized OAI feed:
o cd <esg-search install>/build
o java -Dlog4j.configuration=./log4j.xml -Djava.ext.dirs=../lib/:../lib/fetched esg.search.harvest.impl.HarvestingServiceMain file:///Users/cinquini/Documents/workspace/esg-search/resources/ORNL-oai_dif.xml OAI
o a search for "eosdis" in the Solr admin interface available at http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/ will return 293 records

RUNNING THE SEARCH TOOL

The application contains a command-line tool that can be used to execute some canned queries towards the Solr engine, 
both free text queries and faceted queries. Note that the result of these queries will depend on how the Solr engine has been populated
in the harvesting phase. The Java program can be edited and recompiled to execute different queries that better reflect the 
content of the XML records that were inserted.

To run the search command line tool, do the following:

o Start the Apache Solr engine. 
o If necessary, customize the XML configuration of the ESG service in the file "src/java/main/esg/search/config/search-context.xml":
by default, the search service is configured to contact the Solr engine at http://localhost:8983/solr .
o cd <esg-search install>/build
o java -Dlog4j.configuration=./log4j.xml -Djava.ext.dirs=.:../lib/:../lib/fetched esg.search.query.impl.solr.SearchServiceMain
