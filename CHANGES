CHANGES

1.0.0
Inserted remote Search Web Service API.
The Search Web Service bean is deployed in Spring context as "searchWebService" and can be queries at endpoint of: 
http://<hostname>/<context>/ws/hessian/searchWebService

1.1.0
Inserted support for parsing FGDC records
Inserted support for storing generic service endpoints from THREDDS catalogs, in particular for LAS integration

1.1.1
Removed clause "distrib=true" in searching until federated searches are enabled and tested

1.2.0
Modified Solr schema and harvesting of THREDDS catalogs to store Dataset and File metadata in records of different type (within the same index).

1.2.1
Changes to enable master/slave replication: master Solr running on port 8984 (where metadata is published), 
and slave Solr running on port 8983 (where metadata is queried).
New configuration files in etc/ to support Solr replication, and Jetty security.

1.3.0
Changes to parsing of THREDDS catalogs to enable inheritance of dataset fields into file documents, for better searching.
Record "dataset_version" and "file_version" from THREDDS catalog into Solr field "version", if found.
Improve performance and fail-over logic: 
 - when publishing, commit all records from one THREDDS catalog at once, 
 - when unpublishing, issue single delete statement for top-level dataset and all its children (files)
Start including a version in the schema name (example: ESGF-v1.0).

1.3.1
Inserted facilities for grouping experiments by "experiment_family"

1.4.0
Added support for RSS feeds
Internal changes to URLs resolved by the servlet

1.5.0
- Implementation of new ESGF Search API as agreed upon by search working group
- Stop parsing aggregation endpoints into top-level dataset metadata - all access endpoints must be explicitely defined for the top level dataset
- Inserted support for replica publishing and searching

1.5.1
- Fixes to RSS feed after changes in Solr schema
- Execute distributed search by default

1.6.0
- Expansion of RSS functionality to include federation wide and facet-specific feeds.

1.7.0
- Configuration of distributed search from external registry file containing up to date available shards.
- Support for returning results as Solr/JOSN.
