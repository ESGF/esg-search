CHANGES

1.0.0
Inserted remote Search Web Service API.
The Search Web Service bean is deployed in Spring context as "searchWebService" and can be queries at endpoint of: 
http://<hostname>/<context>/ws/hessian/searchWebService

1.1.0
Inserted support for parsing FGDC records
Inserted support for storing generic service endpoints from THREDDS catalogs, in particular for LAS integration

1.1.1
Removed clause "distrib=true" in searching until federated searches are enabled and tested

1.2.0
Modified Solr schema and harvesting of THREDDS catalogs to store Dataset and File metadata in records of different type (within the same index).

1.2.1
Changes to enable master/slave replication: master Solr running on port 8984 (where metadata is published), 
and slave Solr running on port 8983 (where metadata is queried).
New configuration files in etc/ to support Solr replication, and Jetty security.

1.3.0
Changes to parsing of THREDDS catalogs to enable inheritance of dataset fields into file documents, for better searching.
Record "dataset_version" and "file_version" from THREDDS catalog into Solr field "version", if found.
Improve performance and fail-over logic: 
 - when publishing, commit all records from one THREDDS catalog at once, 
 - when unpublishing, issue single delete statement for top-level dataset and all its children (files)
Start including a version in the schema name (example: ESGF-v1.0).

1.3.1
Inserted facilities for grouping experiments by "experiment_family"

1.4.0
Added support for RSS feeds
Internal changes to URLs resolved by the servlet

1.5.0
- Implementation of new ESGF Search API as agreed upon by search working group
- Stop parsing aggregation endpoints into top-level dataset metadata - all access endpoints must be explicitely defined for the top level dataset
- Inserted support for replica publishing and searching

1.5.1
- Fixes to RSS feed after changes in Solr schema
- Execute distributed search by default

1.6.0
- Expansion of RSS functionality to include federation wide and facet-specific feeds.

1.7.0
- Configuration of distributed search from external registry file containing up to date available shards.
- Support for returning results as Solr/JOSN.
- Support for requesting the logical 'OR' of two values of the same facet.
- Supporting attempts at recovering from error in distributed search, by executing a non-distributed search
- Changed THREDDS harvesting process to keep harvesting when errors are encountered from single catalogs
- Detecting replica catalogs from embedded property is_replica=true/false.

1.7.1
- Fixed bug with querying by dataset_id

1.7.2
- Included "experiment_family" in list of allowed facets

1.7.3
- Included "file_id" as allowed query parameter

1.7.4
- Upgraded dependency on esgf-security module to correctly read the shards file

1.7.5
- Support for negative facet syntax: model=!CCSM
- Support for logging success/error status during crawling of THREDDS catalogs

1.7.6
- Inserted call to node manager prune() function in case of first failed search attempt

1.8.0
- Changed publishing and querying service to use Solr multicores.
- Proper harvesting of variable long names and CF standard names from THREDDS catalogs

1.8.1
- No more checking of facet request parameters versus the configured "allowed" facets
- Changed Solr select request from GET to POST

1.8.2
- Fixed bugs in wget script generation:
	- use MAX_LIMIT=1000 for max number of files
	- output all POST parameters in wget script
	
1.8.3
- Parse xlink documentation into Solr fields, to enable display of technical notes
- Convert all "non-standard" CF names to lower case, and join by "_"
- Inserted extensible framework for enhancement of metadata
	- Applied to publication of technical notes for obs4MIPs datasets
	- Applied to mapping of CMIP5 metadata fields
	
1.9.0
- Support for versioning.
- Optimize index after every commit
- Inserted "data_node", "index_node" and "latest" fields.
- wget script passes unix proxy settings to java, fixed bug 144 and improves
  compatibility with MyProxyLogonGUI. 
- Updated schema.xml to v1.2

1.9.1
- Changed facet-based RSS feeds to be distributed

1.9.2
- Temporarily removed optimization of solr index because it takes too long when harvesting.

1.9.3
- Fixed problem with parsing Solr dates for RSS fields
- Fixed probelm with querying boolean flag "latest"

1.9.4
- Fixed problem with not allowing multiple 'id' values when querying.

1.9.5
- Attached published of tech notes to record "id" field, not "file_id" field
